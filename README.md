# SCCM Battery Health Report Collection and Reporting

This repository includes the `Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1` script, which generates battery health reports for Windows computers, stores them as a new WMI class, and extends SCCM's hardware inventory to include this new data. Additionally, it provides SQL queries for generating reports in SCCM. 

## How to Implement

Follow the steps below to implement this solution:

1. Download the `Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1` script from this repository and customize it according to your SCCM environment's needs.

2. Create a new Package in the SCCM console:
   - Package Name: `Battery Report Collection`
   - Source Folder: Path where `Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1` is stored
   - This package contains source files: Checked
   - Standard Program:
     - Name: `Run Battery Report Collection`
     - Command Line: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1`
     - Program can run: `Whether or not a user is logged on`
   - Schedule the program to run weekly, mid-week with a client-staggered schedule.

3. Extend the SCCM Hardware Inventory to include the new WMI class:
   - In the SCCM console, navigate to `Administration > Client Settings > Default Client Settings`.
   - On the `Default Client Settings` properties page, select `Hardware Inventory`.
   - Click `Set Classes`.
   - Click `Add > Connect`.
   - In the `Connect` window, enter a computer name where the `Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1` script has been run and click `Connect`.
   - In the `Select classes from this namespace` list, select the `BatteryReport` class and click `OK`.

4. Deploy the SCCM Package created in step 2 to all laptops or machines with batteries.

5. Use the provided SQL queries to generate SCCM reports as needed:
   - The first query (`batteryReport.sql`) provides a battery report for all computers with batteries.
   - The second query (`aggregateModels.sql`) aggregates computer models together, providing a count of all computer models that have a battery report.

Please ensure to replace the table and field names in the SQL queries to match the ones generated by the `Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1` script in your SCCM database.

## SQL Queries

### Battery Report by Machine

The `batteryReport.sql` script queries the SCCM database for a list of all machines with batteries, along with detailed battery information.

### Aggregate Computer Models

The `aggregateModels.sql` script provides a count of all computer models that have a battery report.
