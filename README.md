# SCCM Battery Health Report Collection and Reporting

This repository includes the `Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1` script, which generates battery health and system energy reports for Windows computers, stores them in a newly created WMI class, and extends SCCM's hardware inventory to include this new data. It also provides SQL queries to generate reports in SCCM and a guide on how to convert `$rescentUsages` data for SCCM reporting.

## How to Implement

Follow the steps below to implement this solution:

1. Download the `Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1` script from this repository and customize it according to your SCCM environment's needs.

2. Create a new Package in the SCCM console:
   - Package Name: `Battery and Energy Report Collection`
   - Source Folder: Path where `Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1` is stored
   - This package contains source files: Checked
   - Standard Program:
     - Name: `Run Battery and Energy Report Collection`
     - Command Line: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1`
     - Program can run: `Whether or not a user is logged on`
   - Schedule the program to run weekly, mid-week with a client-staggered schedule.

3. Extend the SCCM Hardware Inventory to include the new WMI class:
   - In the SCCM console, navigate to `Administration > Client Settings > Default Client Settings`.
   - On the `Default Client Settings` properties page, select `Hardware Inventory`.
   - Click `Set Classes`.
   - Click `Add > Connect`.
   - In the `Connect` window, enter a computer name where the `Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1` script has been run and click `Connect`.
   - In the `Select classes from this namespace` list, select the `BatteryReport` class and click `OK`.

4. Deploy the SCCM Package created in step 2 to all laptops or machines with batteries.

5. Use the provided SQL queries to generate SCCM reports as needed:
   - The first query (`batteryReport.sql`) provides a battery report for all computers with batteries.
   - The second query (`aggregateModels.sql`) aggregates computer models together, providing a count of all computer models that have a battery report.

Please ensure to replace the table and field names in the SQL queries to match the ones generated by the `Invoke-BatteryReportCollection.ps1` script in your SCCM database.

## SQL Queries

### Battery Report by Machine

The `batteryReport.sql` script queries the SCCM database for a list of all machines with batteries, along with detailed battery and system energy information.

### Aggregate Computer Models

The `aggregateModels.sql` script provides a count of all computer models that have a battery report with aggregate data averaged across the model sample.

## Function: ConvertTo-StandardTimeFormat

The `ConvertTo-StandardTimeFormat` function is an integral part of the script, converting ISO 8601 duration format into a more readable "HH:MM:SS" format.

### Parameters

- `iso8601Duration`: This is the ISO 8601 duration format string that you want to convert into the "HH:MM:SS" format.

### How It Works

The function employs regular expressions to extract hours, minutes, and seconds from the ISO 8601 duration string. Subsequently, it creates a new `TimeSpan` object with these values. Lastly, the function converts this `TimeSpan` into a string with the "HH:MM:SS" format and returns it.

This function primarily aids in the conversion of the Active Runtime and Modern Standby time values obtained from the battery report, making the data more accessible and easier to interpret when stored in the WMI class.
